# Make the cutest picture: this program copies the image shipped in this
# repository to the output directory as entry.png.
# The shipped file is named entry.png and holds JPEG bytes, which the
# rules allow: the format is told apart by the file's first bytes.
# Deterministic: the output bytes are exactly the shipped image bytes,
# so two runs write identical files.
